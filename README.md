worked as an advanced online judge system.

We want to make this platform more powerful, to meed every demand of 
different kind of courses, like:
* Algorithm Problems (Classical OJ)

We want to enhance the Q&A function of the OJ platform, makes it like Leetcode or Stackoverflow, 
and make it related to the academic performance of students, to encourage students to study 
programming better.
